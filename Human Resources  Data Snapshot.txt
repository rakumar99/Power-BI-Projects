Business owners want to know the quick snapshot of Human Resources in the company. I have created this reports as dashboard because a dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives; consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a quick glance or quick snapshot.

Report: General

A Report on the other hand is any informational work. This information can be at any format. Table, Chart, text, number or anything else.
